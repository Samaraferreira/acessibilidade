# Workflow Automation Platform

A visual workflow automation platform built with React, TypeScript, and React Flow that enables users to create, manage, and execute automated workflows through a drag-and-drop interface.

## Functional Requirements

### Workflow Management
- Create, read, update, and delete workflows
- Visual workflow builder with drag-and-drop interface
- Support for multiple node types:
  - Triggers (Webhooks, Schedules)
  - Connectors (Database, REST API)
  - Transformations (Data manipulation)
  - Choices (Conditional branching)
- Node configuration panel for customizing node behavior
- Edge condition management for workflow branching
- Workflow validation to ensure proper structure and connections

### Workflow Execution
- Execute workflows via REST API
- Asynchronous execution through message queuing
- Version control for workflow definitions
- Execution history and status tracking
- Support for parallel execution paths
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### Integration Capabilities
- REST API integration
- Database operations support
- Webhook triggers and notifications
- Custom code execution for transformations
- Message queue integration for scalable processing

### User Interface
- Responsive web interface
- Internationalization support (English and Portuguese)
- Real-time workflow validation
- Interactive node configuration
- Visual feedback for workflow status
- Workflow list with filtering and sorting

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Response time < 2 seconds for workflow operations
- Support for concurrent workflow executions
- Efficient handling of large workflow definitions
- Optimized database queries
- Client-side caching for improved responsiveness

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Message queue-based architecture
- Stateless application design
- Database sharding support
- Load balancing ready

### Reliability
- High availability (99.9% uptime)
- Data persistence and backup
- Graceful error handling
- Transaction management
- Workflow execution retry mechanism

### Security
- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure API endpoints
- Data encryption in transit
- Environment-based configuration

### Maintainability
- Modular architecture
- Clean code practices
- Comprehensive documentation
- Version control
- Automated testing support

### Monitoring
- Execution logging
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- Audit trails
- Health check endpoints

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure environment variables in `.env`:
```
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
AWS_REGION=your-region
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_SQS_QUEUE_URL=your-queue-url
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Start the backend server:
```bash
node server.js
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```
